To make a new document:

* Clone this repository and make a new branch 
* edit template.latex to change formatting
* replace refs.bib with your BibTeX file
* run `make` to build a PDF, `make show` to build the PDF and display it
    using a PDF viewer (default is xdg-open, set using the "viewer" variable)

Citations/references are styled using CSL files, and which style is used is set 
by the csl variable in the Makefile (e.g. `csl=plos`). Pandoc looks for .csl 
files in the working directory as well as ~/.csl. To get all of the .csl files:

    git clone https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles.git ~/.csl
